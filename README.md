## My Course Experience 
My overall experience with Jess's intermediate SQL course has been amazing since I have improved my SQL skills as a result. Before taking the course, I only had beginner level SQL skills, and lacked SQL project experience. However, after going through the lessons and projects, I was able to level up my SQL skills and project experience. Jess's SQL course is highly recommended!
